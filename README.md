This dataset includes labels that explain the linkages between flows connected with harmful or possibly malicious activity to provide network malware researchers and analysts with more thorough information. These labels were painstakingly created at the Stratosphere labs using malware capture analysis.


The most interesting classification problem in this dataset depends on your specific goals and interests. However, from a network security perspective, "Binary Classification - Malicious vs. Benign" is likely the most essential and interesting problem. This is because it addresses the fundamental task of distinguishing between normal and potentially harmful network connections, which is crucial for identifying security threats.
